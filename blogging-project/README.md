This project is a basic web application that allows users to sign in, sign up, and manage their profile information. Additionally, users can create posts and view posts created by other users. The application uses authentication tokens to secure user data and ensure that only authenticated users can access certain features of the application.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

* Spring Boot Dev Tools
* Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA
* MySQL Driver
* Lombok
* Validation
* Swagger

<br>

## Database Configuration
To connect to a MySQL database, update the application.properties file with the appropriate database URL, username, and password. The following properties need to be updated:
```
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<DatabaseName>
spring.datasource.username = <userName>
spring.datasource.password = <password>
spring.jpa.show-sql = true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

```

@ManyToOne
user : currentUserFollower
```
* Comment Model
```
commentId : Integer
commentBody : string
commentCreationTime : LocalDateTime
@ManyToOne
user : commentUser
@ManyToOne
post : instapost
```
* Authentication Token
```
tokenId : Integer
token : string
tokenCreationDate : LocalDate
@OneToOne 
user : User
```
## Data Flow

1. The user at client side sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.
